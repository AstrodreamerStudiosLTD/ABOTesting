# A Bonnie Odyssey Testings

A Bonnie Odyssey is a narrative puzzle game set in the remote islands of Scotland. The island was bought and setup for scientific advancement, but a disaster occurred. You return to the island after it was evacuated 20 years ago to discover what happened to your father, who was lost in the disaster.

This week will be about gauging User Experience for the puzzles across the entire game to help us hone the difficulty curve! In the Play menu of the game, there are 2 buttons. Demo - The demo from the first session with minor bug fixes, and Puzzle Test Map - This is where we would like you to work! The puzzle test map will load in an empty level with the puzzles for the welcome center. The loaded puzzles can be changed in the new Debug Menu, accessed through the pause menu, the puzzle sets are in the same order they appear in the game and should gradually become more complex as you progress through the areas. Some areas include an environmental puzzle piece so be on the lookout for those!

To log your user experience there is a spreadsheet containing the titles of each puzzle. Please MAKE A COPY of this spreadsheet, in the same folder, and input your experience data in there for us to gauge.

Any bugs you encounter can be logged in the issues tab at the top of this repo! There are templates set up for both bugs and crashes, explaining what we would like detailed in each! 

We are aware that puzzle fatigue can set in pretty quickly while doing these tests so please feel free to go into the main demo area and re-test that whenever you like!
