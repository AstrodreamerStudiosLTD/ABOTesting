# A Bonnie Odyssey Testings

A Bonnie Odyssey is a narrative puzzle game set in the remote islands of Scotland. The island was bought and setup for scientific advancement, but a disaster occurred. You return to the island after it was evacuated 20 years ago to discover what happened to your father, who was lost in the disaster.


You will be testing the demo area of our game A Bonnie Odyssey. This provides a rough perspective to the puzzles in the rest of the game and an introduction to the narrative story. 

## First Test
For your first test of the demo, we ask that you focus on User Experience. Marking how difficult you find each puzzle in the Google Form and any notes you would like to suggest on the order or difficulty of the puzzle. Please don't focus on any bugs until you have completed all of the puzzles in the demo.

## Further Tests 
Subsequent tests of the game we would like you to try and break it as much as possible. Soft-locking the puzzle panels, jumping on the batteries, clipping through walls. Any bug you find, please report it using the Issues tab of this github repository.
Any bugs you find in the puzzles themselves; Collisions, incompleteable, ghost lasers, etc. please change the label of the bug report to the PuzzleBug tag.
