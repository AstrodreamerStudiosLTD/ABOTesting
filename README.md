# A Bonnie Odyssey Testings

A Bonnie Odyssey is a narrative puzzle game set in the remote islands of Scotland. The island was bought and setup for scientific advancement, but a disaster occurred. You return to the island after it was evacuated 20 years ago to discover what happened to your father, who was lost in the disaster.

Please break the game. We have updated Chapter 1 - The Welcome Center and addressed all of the issues reported in the first session and more (Pesky crashes still occur). We would like you to re-test this area for the bugs that you previously reported and see if you can find any more! Here is a [changelog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hE87vYhLP_dwVpmUOh_WTMUyL9Uhg_AuBwwp804V550/edit?usp=drive_link) for some of the issues that we have fixed.

Please report any bugs you find using the Github Issues Tab at the top of the page.

The Puzzle Test Map is still included in this build and feel free to continue testing the rest of the puzzles in the game if you are interested!
